# 2022-Interaction-Studies

This directory contains the code to perfomr the spirit action in the Great Interactive Reef. There should be only one running in the reef?!

The files in this directory perform the logic of making day/night happen as well as the distribution of energy level information to the creatures. In addition there is a digital twim UI that shows what is happening in the Great Interactive Reef and makes it possible to steer some benevolent spirit actions.
