# 2022-Interaction-Studies

Imagine an interactive environment: “The Great Interactive Reef”. For this environment you will not have to wear a wet-suit. You can walk through the reef and interact with the reef-creatures to explore and experience their unique behaviours or try to identify the how a benevolent spirit influences all of the creatures, and ultimately controls when they go to sleep.

This repository holds the code for the benevolent spirit controlling the reef and the code-template for the creatures that the minor students will implement in the first two weeks of the Interactive Environmnets minor.
